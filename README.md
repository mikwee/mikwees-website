# LinkRoots
LinkRoots is a libre, lightweight, self-hosted alternative to Linktree.

## How to use it
1. Clone the repository.
2. Replace `background.png` with any background image of your choice.
3. Edit `roots.json` to modify the page. The example should be enough to help you understand the format, but feel free to ask me questions if you still don't get it!
4. Host it!
